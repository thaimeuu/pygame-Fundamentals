## pygame Fundamentals

This repository shows all my codes when I learned pygame through a series of videos by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim). You can find the series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lp3jAExUCewBfMx3UZFkh5).

Although the codes were written by Tim at first, every line of code in this repository was written by me and they are not identical because I had a different approach in a few places.
